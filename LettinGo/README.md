# LettinGo: Explore User Profile Generation for Recommendation System

[![Paper](http://img.shields.io/badge/Paper-arxiv.2411.00418-99D4C8.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18309)

In this paper, we propose **LettinGo**, a novel framework for adaptive and diverse user profile generation in recommendation systems. Instead of relying on rigid supervised fine-tuning formats, LettinGo leverages the expressive capacity of large language models (LLMs) and aligns profile generation directly with downstream recommendation performance. The framework operates in three stages: (1) exploring diverse user profile candidates using multiple LLMs, (2) evaluating profile quality based on their impact on recommendation tasks, and (3) optimizing the profile generator via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using pairwise preferences derived from task outcomes. Experiments show that learning from task-driven feedback enables more flexible, context-aware, and effective user representations, significantly improving recommendation accuracy and adaptability.

This Codebase is GRPO version, DPO version is coming soon.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🧰 Environment Setup
```bash
# step1: create conda env
conda create -n verl python==3.12

# step2: activate env and setup verl
# ref: https://verl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/install.html#install-dependencies
conda init
source ~/.bashrc
conda activate verl
cd duet/verl
USE_MEGATRON=0 bash scripts/install_vllm_sglang_mcore.sh
```

### 🌐 Run API Server
You should start an API server to handle model inference requests for downstream recommendation score tasks.

```bash
cd duet
bash scripts/run_api_call_server.sh
```
Before running the script, make sure to set the correct model path inside the script.

### 🎯 Run Training
You can use the provided script to launch training:

```bash
cd duet
bash scripts/run_training.sh
```
Before running the script, make sure to set the correct paths for your work directory, model, dataset, wandb, and logging directory.
