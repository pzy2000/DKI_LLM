# RepoGenesis Evaluation Harness Dependencies
#
# The harness intentionally has minimal dependencies.
# Docker is required for DSR and Pass@1 evaluation but is called via subprocess.
# No docker SDK dependency needed.

# Rich terminal UI — progress bars and formatted log output.
# Gracefully degrades if not installed (all progress features become no-ops).
rich>=13.0.0

# For running tests:
#   pip install pytest
